after the installation of the momgodb 
we have to run two command prompts to activate the mongodb:
they are as follows:-
-----1-------
1)cd C:\mongodb\bin                               //this is the path where mongodb is installed
2)mongod.exe --dbpath "C:\mongodb\data\db"     //this is to reun the mongod executable file in order to run the 														 mongo.exe

mongod --storageEngine=mmapv1 --dbpath [your-path]  //incase the db is destroyed and again u have to recreate

open another command prompt and type the following code

-------2------

3)cd C:\mongodb\bin
4)mongo


-----------SOME IMPORTANT TEXT--------------

in the mongo db we call the database as databese
table as collection
tuple/row as document
column as field
table join as embedded documents

------------creating the database------------
the synatx is :-
			use database_name

our database name is:-  my_db_crud

------------CREATING A COLLECTION(TABLE)-----------
the following is an example of creating the collectin in mongodb:-

db.createCollection(<name>)

the name is the name of the collection
the collection we created is :-
	db.createCollection(experiment)

----------INSERTING INTO COLLECTION(DOCUMENT)-------
NOTE:-
	in the collection the mongodb automatically allocates the unique id with the name:-"_id" until you assign a value to it

the syntax:-
	db.collectionName.insert({ name: "value" })

eg:-
	db.experiments.insert({_id:1,name:"chandu",age:20})

	db.artists.insert( 				//for multiple documents in a single one we use the []
   [
     { artistname: "The Kooks" },
     { artistname: "Bastille" },
     { artistname: "Gang of Four" }
   ]
)

NOTE:-
	the inserted data is in the form of the "JSON" FORMAT

-------------READING THE DATA--------------
the syntax to return all the documets in the collection is as follows:-
	db.collection_name.find()

eg:-
	db.experiments.find()

to find by a particular field value(i.e the particular column value):-
	db.collection_name.find({field_name:value})

to find with AND condition we just place a comma(,) in the json data
	db.mycol.find(
   {
      $and: [									//$and is the and operator used
         {key1: value1}, {key2:value2}
      ]
   }
)

to find using  OR condition i.e aanyu one of them is present the we use the flg code:-

db.mycol.find(
   {
      $or: [
         {key1: value1}, {key2:value2}
      ]
   }
)

		---LOGICAL OPERATORS USAGE----
Less Than				{<key>:{$lt:<value>}}    db.mycol.find({"likes":{$lt:50}}).pretty()
Less Than Equals		{<key>:{$lte:<value>}}	 db.mycol.find({"likes":{$lte:50}}).pretty()
Greater Than			{<key>:{$gt:<value>}}	 db.mycol.find({"likes":{$gt:50}}).pretty()
Greater Than Equals		{<key>:{$gte:<value>}}	 db.mycol.find({"likes":{$gte:50}}).pretty()
Not Equals				{<key>:{$ne:<value>}}	 db.mycol.find({"likes":{$ne:50}}).pretty()

  	the IN operator:-
  		this is used to find the documents which have the values in it.the following is an example:-
  			db.musicians.find( { instrument: { $in: [ "Vocals", "Guitar" ] } } )
  		
----------PROJECTION QUERIES------------
we can use this to select the particular fields in the documents and show themn

the following is an example:-
	db.experiments.find({name:"chandu"},{age:1})  	//here age:1 means that to show the age field only
													//we can also unselect the fields by placing 0 in 1



-----------SORT IN THE FINDING-----------

we can also sort the data based on the field by placing the sort function after the find().
the following is the syntax:-
		db.collection_name.find().sort({field1:value,field2:value})  //if the value is 1 then ascending order is shown
													   				//if the value is -1 the descending order is shown

-------------UPDATING THE DOCUMENTS(ROWS)------------

to update the rows we use the following code:-
		db.collection_name.update({field1:value},{field2:update_value,field3:update_value})
				//here field1:value is the key value to select the particular document
				//And the remaining fields and values are used to assign the updated values
