after the installation of the momgodb 
we have to run two command prompts to activate the mongodb:
they are as follows:-
-----1-------
1)C:\mongodb\bin                               //this is the path where mongodb is installed
2)mongod.exe --dbpath "C:\mongodb\data\db"     //this is to reun the mongod executable file in order to run the 														 mongo.exe


open another command prompt and type the following code

-------2------

3)cd C:\mongodb\bin
4)mongo
