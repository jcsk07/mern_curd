let us have a form as follows:-

<form class="form"  action="/studentform" method="post" name="regForm">              
    <div class="form-group">
        <input type="text" name="username" class="form-control" id="username" placeholder="Username">
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
</form>


NOTE:-
	in above the the form has "action" which it deviates after we hit the submitting button
	the method=post is the type of request we are sending to the express framework
	the json data consist of {"username":"value"}

	in above we should make a notice that in every input field or anything we are taking the "id" and
	"name" values are same.Keep that in mind......


when we get the post request from the html page we proceed on as follows in the index.js page in express:-

var bodyParser=require('body-parser');
app.use(bodyParser.json());					//used to use the json data comming
app.use(express.urlencoded());


app.post('/studentform',function(req,res){		//as the post request is to the /studentform we are writing the function
	var person = req.body;					//saving the req.body json data to the person variable
	res.send(person.username);				//we are sending the username value in response from person obj
	console.log(JSON.stringify(req.body));	//used to convert the string from json format
	console.log("this is the post request of student form");
});

SO HENCE WE CAN RETRIVE THE JSON DATA FROM THE "FORM" IN THE HTML PAGES
