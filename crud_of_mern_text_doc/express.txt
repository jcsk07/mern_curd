to install express we should use go to the flg commands:-
1)install nodejs in your system
2)create a foler for the express framework

-------------------------creating express ----------------
>npm init          //ithe initialisation f the requires packages
>npm install --save express       //to install the express in the selected folder
>npm install --save nodemon       //used not to restarty the server every time 
				    				for every changes made

-----------------------hello world--------------------------
create a new text document and sab=ve it as index.js
in it type the following code :-

var express = require('express');  //importing the express and saving it to a variable named express
var app = express();               //the express function call is done to the app variiable

app.get('/', function(req, res){
	console.log("visit:- http://localhost:3000")
   res.send("Hello world!");
});

app.listen(3000);

from above line 18 we can say the app.get is method used to define routes in an Express application
the syntax is :-       app.method(path,handler)
in above we see that get is a method used and we also have put,post ect metyhods in app for rout
the path is that the url used to access the page
the handler connsis a function with req-(request),res(response) which tells us what request came and the response sending

the res.send() is used to send the data or rout to the other pages

--------------getting JSON data from the post method------------

to get the json data we use the body-parser package soe we should type the following command:-

npm install --save body-parser

to check if it is installed or not go to the package.json data file 
and check weather it is present in dependencies or not

so to use it we should import the body-parser so in the index.js file type the flg:-

var bodyParser=require('body-parser');
app.use(bodyParser.json());//used for the json data
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })); //used for the url encoded data


app.post('/pandu',function(req,res){        //the json data is present in the body of the request
	console.log(req.body.name);             //we are printing the json data with a specific variable 
    res.json(req.body);                     //sending the json data as a response
	console.log("this is the post request of the json data");
});
